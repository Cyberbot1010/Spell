### Use
1. Write the letters on the board in a single line following the order left -> right and then up -> down
2. Write the coordinates of the corresponding multipliers and leave blank if not applicable (eg 34 or 01)
3. To activate the swap mode (consider the use of a swap) you must put a 1, otherwise it will not be activated
4. The software will return an ordered list with the score, the word without swap, the word with swap (if it is not a swapped word both will be the same) and the coordinate of the initial letter

- The coordinates work with two non-separated numerical digits with values from 0 to 4


# Sample answer
- Normal mode
```bash

```

- Swap mode
```bash

```
